 * would normally â€“ your AI Interviewer will be able to see it.
 * 
 * # K Most Played
 * 
 * You are given a list of `(title, plays)` tuples where the first element is
 * the name of a song, and the second is the number of times the song has been
 * played. You are also given a positive integer `k`. Return the `k` most played
 * songs from the list, in any order.
 * 
 * - If the list has fewer than `k` songs, return all of them.
 * - Break ties in any way you want.
 * - You can assume that song titles have a length of at most `50`.
 * 
 * ```
 * Example:
 * songs = [["All the Single Brackets", 132],
 * ["Oops! I Broke Prod Again", 274],
 * ["Coding In The Deep", 146],
 * ["Boolean Rhapsody", 193],
 * ["Here Comes The Bug", 291],
 * ["All About That Base Case", 291]]
 * k = 3
 * Output: ["All About That Base Case", "Here Comes The Bug", "Oops! I Broke
 * Prod Again"]. Any order of these (excellent) songs would be valid.
 * ```
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * - The length of songs is at most 10^5
 * - Each element in songs is a tuple with a string and an integer
