 * Problem 875: Koko Eating Bananas
 * 
 * Koko needs to eat all bananas within 'h' hours.
 * Each hour, she chooses one pile and eats 'k' bananas from it.
 * If the pile has less than 'k' bananas, she eats all of them and won't eat any
 * more in that hour.
 * The goal is to find the minimum eating speed 'k' that allows her to eat all
 * bananas within 'h' hours.
