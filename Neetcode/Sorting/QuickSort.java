     * Key Points:
     * Average time complexity: O(n log n)
     * Worst case: O(nÂ²) when array is already sorted or reverse sorted
     * It's called "Quick" Sort because it's usually very fast in practice
     * It sorts "in-place" (doesn't need much extra memory)
     * The choice of pivot can greatly affect performance
     * The main idea is "divide and conquer" - 
     * break the big problem into smaller ones by putting smaller elements on one side 
     * and larger elements on the other side of the pivot.
